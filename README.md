# Heart_disease_prediction_using_ML
k-NN classifier 
We are working for an R&D company that focuses on providing healthcare solutions. The company has collected anonymized data from multiple hospitals on several patients. The dataset includes relevant information for each patient, such as their personal information and some medical data, including whether or not they have had heart disease before.

We are tasked with using the dataset to accurately predict the likelihood of a new patient having heart disease in the future. The dataset has the following features:

- `Age`: age of the patient [years]
- `Sex`: sex of the patient [M: Male, F: Female]
- `ChestPainType`: chest pain type [TA: Typical Angina, ATA: Atypical Angina, NAP: Non-Anginal Pain, ASY: Asymptomatic]
- `RestingBP`: resting blood pressure [mm Hg]
- `Cholesterol`: serum cholesterol [mm/dl]
- `FastingBS`: fasting blood sugar [1: if FastingBS > 120 mg/dl, 0: otherwise]
- `RestingECG`: resting electrocardiogram results [Normal: Normal, ST: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV), LVH: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria]
- `MaxHR`: maximum heart rate achieved [Numeric value between 60 and 202]
- `ExerciseAngina`: exercise-induced angina [Y: Yes, N: No]
- `Oldpeak`: oldpeak = ST [Numeric value measured in depression]
- `ST_Slope`: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment [Up: upsloping, Flat: flat, Down: downsloping]
- `HeartDisease`: output class [1: heart disease, 0: Normal]

Please note that in this project k-NN classifier will be utilized
